So when dealing with archinstall from arch linux direct you make come to failed install due to unknown reasons, 
you may have to run gdisk /dev/whateverdisk to delete all partions on that drive, and 
then run cgdisk /dev/whateverdisk to make the partions, 
then mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/whateverdisk and 
mkfs.ext4 /dev/whateverdisk cause it sometimes just like to fails in weird ways.
