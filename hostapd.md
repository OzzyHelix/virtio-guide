I have been experimenting with hostapd and my WiFi card to connect my Quest directly to my PC via a hotspot. I had recommended this method before, but I no longer do so. The main reason is that hostapd can vary significantly based on the WiFi card you use, the country you're in, and your specific setup. For instance, my setup requires a network bridge on the Ethernet adapter for IP resolution. While this can work well, essentially creating a "wireless cable," it is often unreliable.

If you still want to give this setup a try, here are some requirements:

   * Network Bridge: You must use a network bridge with your Ethernet adapter. This can be set up in Cockpit using its web UI.
   * WiFi Card Requirements: You need a WiFi card that supports WiFi 5 (802.11ac) and WiFi 6 (802.11ax). Note that you wonâ€™t be able to use this card for WiFi connections other than the hotspot.
   * Networking Knowledge: You should have a good understanding of networking in Linux.

If you meet these requirements, you can edit the hostapd.conf file to include your SSID and password for the hotspot and change the country code if necessary. and add the interface/wifi adpator you want to use for the hotspot as well as the ethernet bridge name Then, copy the file to `/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf`.

To run the hostapd service, you can do so in Cockpit or use the following command:
`sudo systemctl enable --now hostapd && sudo systemctl status hostapd`
it is also possible to run hostapd directly with `sudo hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf`
this can be helpful for debugging the hotspot if its not working
